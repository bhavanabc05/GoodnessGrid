            generosity finds its purpose, ensuring that resources like food,

          <p>
            Goodness Grid is an online platform that connects donors with
            non-profit organizations and volunteers. We make it easy for
            individuals and businesses to donate surplus items, for NGOs to find
            and claim the resources they need, and for volunteers to contribute
            their time and skills to make a tangible impact.
